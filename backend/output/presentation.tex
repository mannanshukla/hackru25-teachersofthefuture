  \frametitle{Introduction}
  Poverty is a big problem in Africa. Many people don't have enough food, water, or money to live safely.

  \frametitle{Muslims and Christians Fighting in Nigeria}
  In Nigeria, two groups of people, Muslims and Christians, are fighting with each other. This is causing many problems for the country, including:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Many people have been hurt or killed
    \item Homes and businesses have been destroyed
    \item Food and water are scarce because of the fighting
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Why is this a Problem?}
  When Muslims and Christians fight, it makes it harder for everyone to live in peace. This means that people can't focus on solving their problems like poverty.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Conclusion}
  Poverty in Africa is a big problem that needs to be solved. If we don't stop the fighting between Muslims and Christians, it will make things worse for everyone. We need to work together to find solutions to these problems.
